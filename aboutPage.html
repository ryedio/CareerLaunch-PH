          The Nanay’s in IT Program (NITP) is an initiative designed to provide
          opportunities for mothers and individuals who serve as mother figures,
          regardless of gender, to enter and begin a career in the field of
          Information Technology. The program recognizes that being a “nanay” is
          not defined by gender alone, but by the role of caregiving, guidance,
          and support within a family or community.
        </p>

        <p>
          NITP aims to empower participants through free IT training, skills
          development, and hands-on projects that contribute to both personal
          and professional growth. Many of the learners are career shifters,
          returning members of the workforce, or individuals with limited access
          to formal IT education. Through this program, they are given the
          opportunity to acquire new skills and establish a clearer pathway
          toward sustainable employment.
        </p>

        <p>
          The program is supported by Accenture, Philippine Business for Social
          Progress (PBSP), and the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA).
          These partner organizations collaborate to provide training resources,
          mentorship, real-world exposure, and holistic support to the learners.
          Program activities include orientations, site visits, technical
          training sessions, workshops, and community-building events that
          strengthen not only technical competencies but also confidence,
          discipline, and professional values.
        </p>

        <p>
          Under NITP, learners are encouraged to explore their interests and
          develop their chosen IT specialties, such as web development,
          technical support, data handling, and other foundational IT roles. The
          program also places strong emphasis on values formation, teamwork, and
          resilience, which are considered essential for success in the IT
          industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          CareerLaunch PH is a product of the Nanay’s in IT Program and serves
          as a digital platform that showcases the skills, projects, and
          learning journeys of the participants. It stands as a reflection of
          the learners’ dedication and capabilities, while also acting as a
          bridge between the learners and the organizations that support their
          growth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, the Nanay’s in IT Program is more than a training initiative.
          It is a community and an opportunity that opens doors to a more
          inclusive, equitable, and meaningful participation of mothers and
          mother figures in the Information Technology sector.
